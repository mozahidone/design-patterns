To design your code to support switching between different payment processors (e.g., from Bikash to Nagad), you can apply the Strategy design pattern. This pattern allows you to define a family of interchangeable algorithms and encapsulate each one, enabling you to switch between them dynamically.

Here's how you can implement the Strategy pattern in your payment processing code:

Define an interface or abstract class: Create an interface or abstract class that represents the payment processing functionality. This will serve as the common contract for all payment processors.

public interface PaymentProcessor {
void processPayment(Order order);
}

Implement specific payment processors: Implement different payment processors by implementing the interface or extending the abstract class. Each implementation will provide the specific logic for processing payments using a particular payment gateway.

public class Bikash implements PaymentProcessor {

    @Override
    public void processPayment(Order order) {
        // Implement payment processing logic using Bikash
    }
}

public class Nagad implements PaymentProcessor {

    @Override
    public void processPayment(Order order) {
        // Implement payment processing logic using Nagad
    }
}

Implement a context class: Create a context class that will utilize the payment processors based on the desired configuration or runtime selection.

public class PaymentContext {
private PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor;

    public void setPaymentProcessor(PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor) {
        this.paymentProcessor = paymentProcessor;
    }

    public void processPayment(Order order) {
        paymentProcessor.processPayment(order);
    }
}

Use the payment context in your application: In your application code, create an instance of the PaymentContext and configure it with the appropriate payment processor based on your current needs or configurations.

public class PaymentService {
    private PaymentContext paymentContext;

    public void setPaymentContext(PaymentContext paymentContext) {
        this.paymentContext = paymentContext;
    }

    public void processOrderPayment(Order order) {
        paymentContext.processPayment(order);
    }
}
With this design, you can easily switch between different payment processors by setting the appropriate implementation of the PaymentProcessor in the PaymentContext. This allows you to switch from Bikash to Nagad or any other payment processor without making significant changes to the rest of your codebase.

By following the Strategy pattern, you achieve a flexible and modular design that decouples the payment processing logic from the rest of your application, making it easier to introduce new payment processors or switch between existing ones.
